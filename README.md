## 🚀 SYNOPSIS

The `fract'ol` project at 42 school immerses students in the realm of fractal exploration within the C language. This creative endeavor beckons an in-depth understanding of complex mathematical structures and graphical rendering techniques.

Students are tasked with crafting a program that generates and visually renders diverse fractal patterns, delving into the intricate beauty of mathematical artistry.
Beyond the surface, fract'ol serves as a canvas for honing skills in multi-threading, interactive user interfaces, and the manipulation of complex numerical computations.

Leveraging the powerful [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) library, this project seamlessly integrates graphics capabilities, providing students with a versatile toolset for creating visually stunning fractal representations.

Successfully completing this project not only showcases prowess in graphics programming but also underscores a profound appreciation for the intersection of mathematics and computer science in producing visually captivating results.
