CONTROLS :

- Implement better scroll (following mouse position)

COLORS :
- Implement selected colors (R, G, B, W, L)
==> make subfunction for color_hot_swap
==> Make subfunction for fractal_hot_swap
==>						julia_hot_swap

left click => Switch premade color_hotswap
Space bars => color_shifting


NEED FIXING =
Turns char* args colors into chars, for simplicity during arg parsing
Rework s_events numbers, lot are already integrated into the MLX



BONUSES :
- Scroll tracking zoom
- Make the color range shift 

PRIORITY TO DO :
Fine tuning Julia set, why not implementing args values

Add full GCC flags to avoid unsused variable for valgrind

Add reset zoom = 0 number;

shift colors function = -10 if black, +10 if not
