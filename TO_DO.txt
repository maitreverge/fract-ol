Fractals job :
- Implement Julia with different sets (only needs shifting x and y)
( Possibly straight shifting from Mandelbrot)

- Implement a third fractal (burning ship, or other one)

CONTROLS :

- Need refined tunning about the definition + / - keys
- Implement "simple scroll" in the first place.
- Implement better scroll (following mouse position)


COLORS :
- Implement black & white colors if colors not selected (MIN = BLACK, MAX = WHITE)
- Implement selected colors (R, G, B, W, L)


NEED FIXING =
Turns char* args colors into chars, for simplicity during arg parsing


BONUSES :
- A third fractal
- Scroll tracking zoom
- Move the fractal with keys
- Make the color range shift
