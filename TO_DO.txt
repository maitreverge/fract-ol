Rename print_mandelbrot function

Work on better guides

Reimplement numbers


NEED FIXING =
Turns char* args colors into chars, for simplicity during arg parsing
Rework s_events numbers, lot are already integrated into the MLX



BONUSES :
- Scroll tracking zoom
- Make the color range shift 

PRIORITY TO DO :
Fine tuning Julia set, why not implementing args values

Add full GCC flags to avoid unsused variable for valgrind

Add reset zoom = 0 number;

shift colors function = -10 if black, +10 if not
